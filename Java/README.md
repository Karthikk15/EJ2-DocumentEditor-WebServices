## Enabling Cross origin requests for Web APIs
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a protocol that enables scripts running on a browser client to interact with resources from a different origin. In the client side we can make only API calls to the URLs that live in the same origin where the script is running or else it will be blocked as per [Same-Origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)

When the server configured correctly to allow cross-origin resource sharing some special headers will be included in the response. Based on that browser will determine to proceed with the request or should fail.

### How to enable CORS in Java Spring boot
You can enable CORS per action, per controller, or globally for all Web API controllers in your application. Kindly follow below steps to achieve it.

### Enabling global CORS
 Enable CORS for the whole application be declaring `WebMvcConfigurer` bean
